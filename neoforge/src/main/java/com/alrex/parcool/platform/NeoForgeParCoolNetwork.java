/**
 * NeoForge network plumbing, built on the raw {@code NetworkManager}.
 *
 * <p>{@code NetworkChannel} cannot be used here: it registers a C2S and an S2C receiver under one id,
 * and NeoForge 21.1 refuses the second registration. With the raw API a bidirectional message is
 * simply registered twice under two different ids, which {@code NetworkRegistries} does. Sending
 * therefore addresses the message by its explicit id rather than by channel lookup.
 *
 * <h2>Why registration goes through the id overload</h2>
 * Architectury has two {@code NetworkManager.registerReceiver} overloads, and only the id-based one is
 * usable together with the id-based {@code sendTo*(id, buf)} that this class uses:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>the <b>id-based</b> one fills {@code NetworkAggregator.C2S_TYPE} / {@code S2C_TYPE} with
 *     {@code id -> new Type<BufCustomPacketPayload>(id)}, and the id-based send reads the type from
 *     exactly that map;</li>
 *     <li>the <b>Type-based</b> one only fills {@code C2S_CODECS} / {@code S2C_RECEIVER} /
 *     {@code C2S_TRANSFORMERS} and leaves the {@code *_TYPE} maps empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Registering the Type-based way and sending by id therefore produced
 * {@code NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "CustomPacketPayload$Type.id()" because "type" is null}
 * inside {@code NetworkAggregator.collectPackets} on the very first client -&gt; server packet, which
 * ParCool sends from {@code PlayerJoinHandler} during login. The exception propagates out of
 * {@code ClientboundLoginPacket#handle}, and NeoForge answers by dropping the connection with
 * "Network Protocol Error" - so on NeoForge the whole C2S direction (stamina reports, action sync,
 * the client-settings packet) was dead. It stayed invisible because the dedicated-server test never
 * had a client connect, and an integrated server does not send its own login packet.
