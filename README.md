# ParCool — Architectury API port

A multiloader port of the Minecraft mod **ParCool** by **alRex_U** (LGPL-3.0), originally built for
NeoForge, reworked onto the [Architectury API](https://github.com/architectury/architectury-api) so
that one codebase ships both a **Fabric** and a **NeoForge** artifact.

Minecraft **1.21.4**, Java **21**, Gradle **9.4.1**.

The mod itself is unchanged: 26 actions, the zipline and hook blocks, the stamina system, the full
animation set and the settings screens are all there, and the four optional NeoForge integrations are
wired. See [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) for what had to be retargeted and what was verified.

### Packaging

The Fabric distributable is built from `:common`'s `remapJar` output, so it ships intermediary
bytecode with the mixin targets statically remapped into it, and there is deliberately **no
refmap**: Loom 1.17 defaults to `mixinRemapType = static` and fabric-api ships none either. The
access widener in the Fabric jar is in `v2 intermediary`, which is what a production Fabric client
requires.

The NeoForge distributable ships mojmap-named bytecode, because that is what the NeoForge production
runtime loads: NeoForge 21.4 has no SRG step in front of a mod jar. `accesstransformer.cfg` is
written in the same naming. architectury-plugin's `neoForge()` transform is therefore not used; it
needs a Loom-based NeoForge setup, and the assembly is done explicitly instead.

**Known limitation:** the ShoulderSurfing integration is NeoForge-only in practice. If ShoulderSurfing
ships a `PluginLoader` for NeoForge and none for Fabric, the `shouldersurfing_plugin.json` in the
Fabric jar is never read, and the decoupled-camera hook is absent on Fabric rather than broken there.

## Modules

| Module     | Contents                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `common`   | The whole mod: registries, `ParCoolData` (replacement for NeoForge's attachment API), the network layer, the JSON config backend, the vanilla mixins, and the platform seam. |
| `fabric`   | Fabric entrypoints, `FabricParCoolPlatform` / `FabricParCoolNetwork`, and the ServiceLoader binding.                                                                |
| `neoforge` | NeoForge entrypoints, `NeoForgeParCoolPlatform` / `NeoForgeParCoolNetwork`, plus the optional Paraglider, EpicFight and BetterThirdPerson integrations.           |

There is intentionally **no source-set split**: ParCool is client-authoritative, and NeoForge ships a
merged jar, so `common` stays a single tree. The two loader modules differ only in their entrypoints
and their platform implementation. `./gradlew :common:checkCommonLoaderIndependence` fails the build
if `common/src/main` ever imports `net.fabricmc.*` or `net.neoforged.*`.

## Requirements

* JDK 21 (pinned through the Gradle toolchain in `build.gradle`, no machine-specific path needed)

## Building

```bash
./gradlew :common:build   # on a clean checkout, once
./gradlew build           # from then on
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the module layout, the dev run tasks
(`:fabric:runClient`, `:neoforge:runclient`, `:fabric:runServer`, `:neoforge:runserver`) and the
loader-independence check.

## Installing

Drop the matching jar into `mods/`:

* Fabric — `fabric/build/libs/parcool-1.21.4-3.4.3.3-fabric.jar`
* NeoForge — `neoforge/build/libs/parcool-neoforge.jar`

## Dependencies

**Required**

* Architectury API 16.1.4 or newer
* Fabric: [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) 0.119.4+1.21.4, Fabric Loader 0.16.14+
* NeoForge 21.4.0 or newer
* MixinExtras 0.4+ — bundled by both loaders, declared as an *optional* dependency in both mod
  descriptors because `common/…/mixin/common/PlayerMixin` uses `@WrapWithCondition` from it. It stays
  optional on purpose: declaring it required makes NeoForge refuse to start, because the loaders
  bundle it rather than listing it as a mod.

**Optional**

* [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) — in-game guide
* [ShoulderSurfing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shouldersurfing) — compiled against
  the 1.21.4 build; a version for a different Minecraft version reports itself absent and ParCool
  falls back to its own camera handling
* [EpicFight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epicfight) — NeoForge only. **EpicFight has
  no 1.21.4 build on CurseForge**, so the integration is compiled against its 1.21.1 API but reports
  itself absent at runtime (`EpicFightManager#isEpicFightUsable` checks the class is loadable) and
  ParCool falls back to its own stamina system.
* BetterThirdPerson — NeoForge only, compiled against its 1.21.4 build and reported absent on a
  client that does not have it
* [Paraglider](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paraglider) — NeoForge only. **Paraglider
  has no 1.21.4 build in the CurseForge listing this port could reach**, so the integration is
  compiled against its 1.21.1 API and reports itself absent otherwise.
