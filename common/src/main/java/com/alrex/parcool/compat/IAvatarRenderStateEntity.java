/**
 * The duck interface {@code mixin.client.AvatarRenderStateEntityMixin} adds to
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.state.AvatarRenderState}.
 *
 * <p>1.21.9 entity renderers no longer see the entity while rendering: {@code setupRotations} and
 * {@code PlayerModel#setupAnim} only get a render state, and a state holds no entity reference. ParCool's
 * animators are keyed on the player, so the player has to travel with the state - the mixin writes it in
 * while the render state is extracted and the two mixins read it back through this interface.
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code compat} and not in the mixin package because mixin refuses to let a class in
 * its own package be referenced from ordinary code
 * ({@code IllegalClassLoadError: ... is in a defined mixin package}).
