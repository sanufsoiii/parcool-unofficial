/**
 * The duck interface {@code mixin.client.PlayerRenderStateEntityMixin} adds to
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.renderer.entity.state.PlayerRenderState}.
 *
 * <p>From 1.21.2 on, entity renderers no longer see the entity while rendering: {@code setupRotations}
 * and {@code PlayerModel#setupAnim} only get a render state, and a state holds no entity reference
 * (1.21.1 handed both of them the {@code AbstractClientPlayer} itself). ParCool's animators are keyed on
 * the player, so the player has to travel with the state - the mixin writes it in while the render state
 * is extracted and the two mixins read it back through this interface.
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code compat} and not in the mixin package because mixin refuses to let a class in
 * its own package be referenced from ordinary code
 * ({@code IllegalClassLoadError: ... is in a defined mixin package}).
