/**
 * Carries the rendered player on {@link PlayerRenderState}.
 *
 * <p>Since 1.21.2 entity renderers no longer see the entity while rendering: {@code setupRotations} and
 * {@code PlayerModel#setupAnim} only get a render state, and a state holds no entity reference.
 * ParCool's animators are keyed on the player (its {@code Animation}, its {@code Parkourability}, its
 * pose and head yaw), so the player has to travel with the state.
 *
 * <p>Written in {@link PlayerRenderStateExtractorMixin} while the render state is extracted, i.e. at
 * the same point in the frame where 1.21.1's {@code setupRotations} could still read the entity. The
 * field is created lazily - mixin field initialisers run in the mixin's own constructor and are
 * unreliable for a state object the renderer pool reuses.
