/**
 * ParCool's two jump hooks, which 1.21.7 moved up from {@code Player} to {@code LivingEntity}
 * (1.21.1 had {@code Player#jumpFromGround} overriding the inherited method, so the mixin could
 * target {@code Player} and the cast was safe). Living entities that are not players return
 * immediately, which is what the cast used to guarantee.
 *
 * <h2>Why the second hook has to run at TAIL</h2>
 * It was {@code LivingEvent.LivingJumpEvent}, which NeoForge fires from
 * {@code LivingEntity#jumpFromGround} HEAD. It has to run at <b>TAIL</b> instead, because
 * NeoForge 21.1 made the vanilla jump absolute while vanilla made it relative:
 *
 * <pre>
 * vanilla 1.21.1:  setDeltaMovement(getDeltaMovement().add(0, 0.42, 0))
 * NeoForge 21.1:   setDeltaMovement(vec3.x, getJumpPower(), vec3.z)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>So an impulse added before {@code super.jumpFromGround()} is silently overwritten on NeoForge
 * and only survives on Fabric. Measured on NeoForge: the charge jump set
 * {@code dy -0.0784 -> 0.0816} and the first airborne tick still reported the untouched vanilla
 * {@code dy 0.3332} - i.e. the {@code +0.16 * power} boost was discarded and the jump was the
 * normal one block. TAIL also gives {@code Dive#onJump} the real launch velocity instead of the
 * resting {@code -0.0784}.
 *
 * <p>Verified against 1.21.7's vanilla, which now writes
 * {@code setDeltaMovement(vec3.x, Math.max((double) getJumpPower(), vec3.y), vec3.z)}: the jump is
 * still the last thing that touches the vertical velocity inside the method, so the boost
 * {@code ChargeJump} applies from {@code onStartInLocalClient} (after {@code LivingEntity#travel})
 * still has to be followed by this TAIL hook rather than being applied before the jump. The
 * injection point is unchanged; nothing was moved back to HEAD.
