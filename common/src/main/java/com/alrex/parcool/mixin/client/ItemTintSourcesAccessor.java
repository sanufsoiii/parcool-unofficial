/**
 * Exposes {@code ItemTintSources}' private id mapper.
 *
 * <p>1.21.9 resolves every item model tint through a codec keyed by an {@link ResourceLocation}, and the
 * mapper is a private static {@link LateBoundIdMapper} that only {@code ItemTintSources#bootstrap}
 * (vanilla's eight entries) writes to. There is no public registration API on either loader any more -
 * Architectury 19 removed {@code ColorHandlerRegistry.registerItemColors} - so ParCool's rope tint
 * has to be added here. The mapper is late-bound, so writing to it after {@code CODEC} was built is
 * fine, which is what lets the registration happen from the client entry point.
