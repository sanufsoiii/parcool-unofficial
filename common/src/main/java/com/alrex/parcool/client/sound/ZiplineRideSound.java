/**
 * Owns the single {@link ZiplineRideSoundInstance} that plays while the local player rides a rope.
 *
 * <p>{@code RideZipline} lives in {@code common} and is loaded on a dedicated server, so the client
 * sound engine is only ever touched from here.
 *
 * <h2>Why every step is guarded</h2>
 * A throw anywhere in here used to propagate out of {@code Action#start}, which the
 * {@code ActionProcessor} try/catch turns into a force-stopped action - so a broken sound silently
 * killed the whole zipline ride, animation included. Sound setup must therefore never be able to
 * break the action that owns it.
