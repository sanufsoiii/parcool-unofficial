 * 2.09 s loop ({@code assets/parcool/sounds/zipline_slide.ogg}), so this instance is a
 * {@code looping} sound that follows the player and scales its volume and pitch with the current
 * speed instead of being re-triggered every few ticks.
 *
 * <p>Kept in its own client-only class: {@code RideZipline} itself is loaded on a dedicated server.
