/**
 * ParCool's two player attributes, resolved as {@link Holder}s out of the built-in attribute
 * registry.
 *
 * <p>They are attached to the player by {@code mixin.common.PlayerAttributesMixin}, which extends the
 * builder {@code Player#createAttributes} assembles - what {@code EntityAttributeRegistry} would have
 * done, except that on NeoForge it rejects a second supplier for {@code EntityType.PLAYER} and on
 * Fabric it <i>replaces</i> the player's whole supplier, which costs the player
 * {@code minecraft:generic.max_health} and makes joining a world fail.
 *
 * <p><b>Why the two loaders register them differently.</b> {@code BuiltInRegistries.ATTRIBUTE} is
 * writable only while {@code Bootstrap#bootStrap} is running, and that pass is the one thing that
 * reaches {@code DefaultAttributes}' static initialiser, i.e. {@code Player#createAttributes}, on
 * Fabric. NeoForge closes the built-in registries before the mod constructors run, so a direct
 * {@code Registry.registerForHolder} there dies with "Registry is already frozen (trying to add key
 * parcool:max_stamina)" and NeoForge cannot start at all. There is no vanilla hook that sits inside
 * the writable window on both loaders - {@code Bootstrap#validate} runs before the freeze on Fabric
 * and after it on NeoForge - so this is a real platform split:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Fabric</b>: the static initialiser below registers the two entries, and it is reached
 *     from {@code Bootstrap#bootStrap} through the mixin.</li>
 *     <li><b>NeoForge</b>: {@code :neoforge}'s {@code NeoForgeAttributes} registers them through
 *     NeoForge's own {@code DeferredRegister} (which fires on {@code NewRegistryEvent}, while the
 *     registry is still open) - exactly what upstream ParCool's NeoForge build does. Architectury's
 *     {@code DeferredRegister} is not an option: it rejects
 *     {@link net.minecraft.core.registries.Registries#ATTRIBUTE} outright
 *     ({@code RegistrarManager._get} asserts on it).</li>
 * </ul>
 * On NeoForge the holders are therefore read back from the registry instead of being written to it;
 * they are consumed as {@link Holder}s by {@code AttributeSupplier.Builder#add} and
 * {@code Player#getAttribute(Holder)}, so a plain read is enough.
